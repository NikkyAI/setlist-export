# mixx tracklist exporter

## how to use

just execute (doubleclick) the `.exe`

all playlists in the VirtualDJ database (XML) will be exported into tracklists as `txt` files

(existing files will be updated)

alternatively a `.cue` file or folder containing them can be dragged onm the `exe` to parse only those

this tool requires `cue` files  
virtualdj creates `cue` files when recording a set  
the files are by default found automatically

when lacking `cue` files the track data might be less accurate
