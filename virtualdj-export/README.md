# mixx tracklist exporter

## how to use

just execute (doubleclick) the `.exe`

all playlists in the VirtualDJ database (XML) will be exported into tracklists as `txt` files

(existing files will be updated)

alternatively a `.cue` file or folder containing them can be dragged onm the `exe` to parse only those

this tool requires the `cue` files that virtualdj creates when recording a set for giving more accurate exports
the files are by default found automatically
