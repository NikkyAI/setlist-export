# mixx tracklist exporter

## how to use

just execute (doubleclick) the `.exe`

all playlists in the VirtualDJ database (XML) will be exported into tracklists as `txt` files

(existing files will be updated)

getting mre than just the trackname proves itself to be fairly complicated 
since there is no consistency in the virtualdj "database" xml file  
working on it
